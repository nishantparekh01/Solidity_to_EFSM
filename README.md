# casino_conversion
Resources created for research on converting Solidity smart contracts to Extended Finite State Machines (EFSMs) are to be found in the branch `trial_different_efsm_framework`. It contains scripts for automatically converting Solidity smart contracts to EFSMs and the generated models as well. The models are present in `models` directory in branch `trial_different_efsm_framework`.

Mentioned hereafter are the instructions to run the scripts for yourself. Once the repository has been cloned, path to the smart contract to be converted can be specified in the file `json_contract.py` right after importing the neccessary modules on line 3, which is stored in the variable `contract_file`. To specify the output directory, please navigate to file `xml_generator.py`. The last section in file `xml_generator.py` contains neccesary paths required to specify where the generated output should be stored. Please feel free to edit that according to your requirements.
