The output of test_supremica_generator.py represents an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a smart contract. The AST details various states and
 transitions of the contract. Let's break down each component of the AST:

Overall Structure
Events: This section is currently empty. Normally, it would list events that the contract can emit.
Components: This section contains several subcomponents that define different states and transitions within the smart contract.
Components Breakdown
VariableComponent: This section is currently empty. In a fully fleshed-out AST, it would define state variables and their initial values.

# The following output corresponds to the casino.sol file.

1. inState: This component represents a state and contains transitions based on events.

edge_list:
t0: Transitions triggered by createGame, placeBet, and decideBet events. It requires the state to be equal to _state.
t1: This transition doesn't have specific events, guards, or actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. byOperator: This component contains transitions managed by the operator.

edge_list:
t0: Triggered by events like createGame, decideBet, addToPot, and removeFromPot. It requires the message sender (msg.sender) to be the operator.
t1: This transition doesn't have specific events, guards, or actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. noActiveBet: This component deals with transitions when there is no active bet.

edge_list:
t0: Triggered by the removeFromPot event. It requires the state to be either State.IDLE or State.GAME_AVAILABLE.
t1: This transition doesn't have specific events, guards, or actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. "" (Unnamed Component): This component sets initial states or performs basic assignments.

edge_list: Contains several transitions setting initial values for variables like operator, state, timeout, pot, and wager.bet.
createGame: Defines the transitions involved in creating a game.

edge_list:
t0: Sets hashedNumber to hashNum.
t1: Changes the state to State.GAME_AVAILABLE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. placeBet: Handles placing a bet.

edge_list:
t0: Ensures msg.sender is not the operator.
t1: Ensures the bet amount is valid.
t2: Assigns the player.
t3: Sets the wager.
t4: Changes the state to State.BET_PLACED.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. decideBet: Determines the outcome of a bet.

edge_list:
t0: Validates the hashed number.
t1: Determines if the secret number is heads or tails.
t2: Calls playerWins if the guess is correct.
t3: Calls operatorWins if the guess is incorrect.
t4: Conditional statement handling win/loss.
t5: Resets the state to State.IDLE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. playerWins: Handles the logic when a player wins.

edge_list:
t0: Temporarily stores the wager amount.
t1: Resets the wager.
t2: Reduces the pot.
t3: Transfers winnings to the player.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. operatorWins: Handles the logic when the operator wins.

edge_list:
t0: Adds the wager to the pot.
t1: Resets the wager.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. addToPot: Adds funds to the pot.

edge_list:
t0: Increases the pot by msg.value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. removeFromPot: Removes funds from the pot.

edge_list:
t0: Decreases the pot by a specified amount.
t1: Transfers the amount to the operator.


Summary
The AST describes a betting game smart contract with various states and transitions. It includes rules for creating a
game, placing a bet, deciding the bet outcome, and handling fund transfers between the pot, the player, and the
operator.Each component in the AST corresponds to a particular state or operation within the smart contract, detailing
the conditions and actions associated with state transitions.
